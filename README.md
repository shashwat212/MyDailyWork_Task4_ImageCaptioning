# 🖼️ MyDailyWork_Task4_ImageCaptioning

An **AI-powered Image Captioning system** that automatically generates natural language descriptions for images using **Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing (NLP)**.

---

## 📌 Project Description

This project demonstrates an **Image Captioning model** that analyzes an image and generates a meaningful textual description.  
It uses a **pre-trained deep learning vision-language model**, combining image understanding with language generation.

The goal of this task is to understand how **Computer Vision and NLP work together** in real-world AI applications.
